# Customer Banking
This python file allows the banking customer to enter values for balance, interest rate, and duration in months to calculate the interest earned and resulting balance for a savings and CD account. This is achieved by importing the savings account and cd account functions and defining a main function for the file that prompts the customer to enter their account information and applies the imported functions to the customer inputs. The functions are called and the customer inputs are passed to the function. The interest earned and updated balance are then displayed for the customer's savings and cd accounts.
# Account
This python file provides starter code in the form of an Account class which will be imported to create the savings account and cd account functions.
